            an you actually be future-proof in a time of rapid
            technological change? It is a question that many businesses
            are asking, as technologies such as articial intelligence (AI)
            and automation supercharge the pace of innovation worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technological innovation is coming faster than ever, with 94pc of tech
            decision-makers saying that the rate of technological advancement is
            higher now than three years ago, according to the Accenture
            Technology Vision 2019 report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Businesses need to keep abreast of technology megatrends and adapt to
            stay relevant, says Neil Bellamy, head of technology, media and
            telecoms at NatWest. “We're in the middle of a fundamental change
            from an industrial age to an increasingly digital age,” he says.
            “Innovation is more and more rapid.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr Bellamy says that British businesses need to “avoid obsessing on
            individual technologies or fads to look beyond the immediate horizon
            and consider megatrends and convergent technologies. These will
            shape not only their business but whole sectors and industries.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “All businesses are being framed by one macro force: complexity,” says
            Nelson Phillips, professor of strategy and innovation at Imperial
            College Business School in London. “From automotive to nancial
            services, retail to leisure and luxury, adapting to the disruption
            associated with new technologies, and complex customer and
            consumer demand, is framing everything. Digital strategy has become
            corporate strategy. It is reshaping how whole industries work.”

            Even small businesses are facing huge change from technologies such as artificial intelligence, along with opportunities to innovate. The two most important trends for businesses to grapple with are big data and AI, says Prof Nelson Phillips of Imperial College Business School in London.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prof Phillips says: “These are the two technologies that I hear businesses talking about the most. These technologies are fundamentally reshaping how companies think about solving problems, innovating and creating value for customers.

            Consumer expectation is also changing, with sustainability and recycling – the circular economy – now increasingly important. Research in 2017 by Unilever suggested that 33pc of consumers want to buy from companies they see as “doing good”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changes driven by technology and increased consumer demand for sustainability are affecting businesses in every sector, says Jon Tipple, global chief strategy officer of branding agency Future Brand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prof Philips says: “Beyond technology, I think climate change could more correctly be called a megatrend. It is big, on the horizon, and companies need to be doing something.”

            Businesses face challenges not just from evolving technology but from market conditions and external factors such as Brexit, says Mr Kerr. “Our research reveals clear external challenges for business decision-makers around the globe. These are technological change, and skills shortages.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Interestingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, British businesses were alone in ranking government policies and international politics at the top of their list of concerns. This indicates how ongoing Brexit negotiations are uniquely absorbing a lot of time and effort among organisations.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In many industries, the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution poses both challenges and opportunities, with technologies such as smart factories projected to add $3.7trn (£2.9trn) in value to the world economy by 2025, according to McKinsey research.

            Companies need to take an innovative approach to keep up, says Emilie Colker, London managing director of design and innovation company IDEO. “By only following a traditional, analytical approach, there’s a huge risk that businesses will all end up at the same point, with very little to differentiate them,” she says.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The ability to innovate will be critical to the next wave of stand-out companies, and that relies on a culture of creativity, which is inherently risky and requires outside thinking.”

            To succeed in a business environment that is more competitive than ever, businesses need to listen to new voices, both internally and externally, says Stefan Haase, director at Whitecap Consulting.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means listening to employees, and also to clients and partners outside the company, he says – in fact, this is an essential, untapped resource that businesses ignore at their peril.

            “Almost every business will have a number of people that for one reason or another are not heard at board level,” he says. “Employees and managers at the heart of the business spot gaps as well as opportunities, but the business culture often prevents these being articulated.”

            Businesses should also consult clients, partners and customers, Mr Haase believes. “Reaching out to clients and partners is equally important as external stakeholders should be consulted when it comes to innovation and future-proofing the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It depends on the business and the circumstance, but typically collaborations can speed up innovation projects and ensure that new products and services can be provided to customers more quickly. It’s not the only way, but increasingly a method that is growing in importance and impetus.”

            “The only way to innovate is to innovate with customers, suppliers, and others in the supply chain,” he says. “And this is getting to be more and more true as industries move on to platforms of various kinds and as digital transformation reshapes industries.
